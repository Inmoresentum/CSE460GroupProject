## Issues

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in somewhere?
You can help
by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Inmoresentum/LaTeXProjectReportCSE460/issues).
Before you create an issue, make sure to search for the issue archive -- your issue may have already been addressed,
and there maybe a temporary workaround!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _**Reproducible**._ include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _**Specific**._ include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- _**Unique**._ do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _**Scoped to a `single bug`.**_ one bug per report.
